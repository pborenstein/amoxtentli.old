# Things I'll Never Know

What it feels like to look at an equation and to understand what it means. I imagine that equations are like sentences to mathematicians. I can sound out formulas term by term like someone who can't read can sound out words, but I have no idea what I'm saying.

Like what does e^{i\pi }+1=0 really mean? What does "the base of natural logarithms" even mean?

What it feels like to sit at a piano and, well, just play.

What it feels like to be able to look at something and draw it.

What it feels like to be able to track a game of chess in your head.
How you could remember what a board looks like.

To be able to keep more than three things in my head at the same time.
