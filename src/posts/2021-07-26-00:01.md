summary: "My partner makes a carafe of coffee every morning ..."
---


My partner makes a carafe of coffee every morning, and depending on how she slept, there's either a cup or so left for me, or not. This morning she drank the entire carafe. 

But I just wanted a cup, so I thought: “I bet the grounds in the coffee maker are still good. I mean, for ONE cup of coffee, right? How bad could it be?”

Reader, very.
